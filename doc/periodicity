Description:
Periodicity in nucleosome positioning along the gene.

Details:
Score is a measure of the phase between the first (immediately downstream 
or covering the TSS) and the last (immediately upstrem from the TTS) 
nucleosomes.
Specifically, given a periodic distance between neighboring nucleosomes, T,  
the score is computed as the residue of the nuc.length (distance between 
dyads of the first and the last nucleosomes within the gene) divided by the
period (T=165 bp in S. cerevisiae).
Therefore a score of 0 means the nucleosomes are completeley phased and a
score of T/2 (82 in S. cerevisiae) corresponds to totally anti-phased 
nucleosomes.

Autocor is computed directly from the experimental coverage and is a
quantitative measure of the periodicity of the nucleosomes inside the
gene-body, ranging from 0 (non-periodic) to 1 (periodic).
