Description: 
Classification of genes according to nucleosome architecture around their TSS.

Details:
Nucleosome architectures around TSSs can be been classified based on the width
of its NFRs (closed (c) or open (o)) and the positioning of the âˆ’ 1 and + 1
nucleosomes (missing (M), fuzzy (F), well-positioned (W) or uncertain).
Therefore, a transcription start stide can be classified as any of the
following:
W-c-W, F-c-F, W-c-F, F-c-W, W-o-W, F-o-F, W-o-F, F-o-W, 
W-overlap-W, F-overlap-F, W-overlap-F, F-overlap-W, -1-missing, +1-missing.
Additionally, when the -1 and +1 nucleosomes overlap, an extra category is 
defined (overlap).
