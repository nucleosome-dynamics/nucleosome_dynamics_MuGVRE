Description: 
Apparent stiffness of a nucleosome derived from Gaussian fitting of its 
coverage

Details: 
The coverage corresponding to a single nucleosome call can be fitted to a
Gaussian distribution according to three parameters: m, sd, and k.

k is the height of the curve's peak.
m is the position of the center of the peak.
sd is it's standard deviation and controls the width of the bell.

Then, the apparent stiffness for the given nucleosome can be derived
from the sd of the Gaussian function.
